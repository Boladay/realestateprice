# Real estate housing price prediction.
----------------------------------------
## Overview:

For this project i will be tackling a regression problem. I will be predicting the housing cost of houses using
a Melbourne Real Estate dataset. The dataset includes over 10,000 datapoints. The dataset has over 21 features such as address, 
number of rooms, number of bathrooms, landsize, distance from city centre, price etc. Using these feature i will be able to create a 
regression model which should accurarly predict the price of the house based on their features.
